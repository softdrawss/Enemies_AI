# RPG Enemies AI

Hello, my name is Júlia Serra Trujillo and I am a student of the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games at Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimèdia (CITM), at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). 

This page contents information about RPG Enemies AI, their patterns and information about different enemies in games, and has been created for the subject Project II.

## Enemies and Bosses AI Patterns
The enemy AI controls their behaviour (moving, attacking, responding to certain acts, etc). Besides the individual enemy AI, in games where is expected to fight groups of enemies, developers create an AI for the enemy grouping.
#### Enemies Attacking AI



### Types of AI found in enemies

### Enemy Behaviour
The main objective for designers when creating enemies is engage the player to fight until a reward is given and feel like a real fight.

### Subdivisions of Enemies
When we try to split enemies into different categories, we tend to think of strenght. Different levels of strenght allows to give the player various levels of challenge and enables them to see how much they progressed when they are putted against the fodder enemies later in the game. Usually in games, the groups are kept evenly spread, with higher groups being smaller because they required more work to create.

Taking in mind the strenght of the enemies is important when developing their AI, but so it is their purpose in the game. Each enemy can have a different role in the gameplay and that will depend when they are introduced, their mechanics, their behaviour, and most important, how the player should react to them. This splits enemies into four major reoccurring roles: Emphasizers, Enforcers, Smashers and Challengers. 

#### Smashers
Can easily be defeated and allow the player to have fun smashing them up. They are usually the ones that are first introduced to the player when the game starts and can form a basic challenge, specially for new gamers who do not feel confident in their skills.

#### Emphasizers
Emphasize a certain mechanic. They encourage players to use specific attacks or abilities against them to defeat them, yet at the same time it is still possible to take them out by regular means such as basic attacks. They are meant to test the player’s skill in specific mechanics and are introduced after new mechanics are introduced.

Emphasizers hold the danger of the player not knowing there is a better way to fight the enemy, and that can cause the fight to drag on for too long. To mitigate this risk, it is important to communicate to players what to expect from a different enemy and how to best fight them by using tutorials and taking in mind the learning curbe.

#### Enforcers
They force the player to use only some specific mechanic to defeat them, with the others having little or (more often) no effect. Like Emphasizers, they are meant to test the player’s skill in specific mechanics when new mechanics are introduced, but adding the important part of teaching the players that they can only be defeated with this new skills and that some special attacks do not affect them.

Enforcers must force players to learn how to fight them and also give a feeling of satisfaction when doing it right.

#### Challengers
Tougher enemies which are meant to challenge the player and test their skills. 

## What to take in mind
- OFFSCREEN: Enemies must attack on screen, almost never off screen. Take this in mind specially when developing 2D games to make enemies be aware of the camera limits or it will result in frustration for players as they will recieve damage without seeing who is attacking.
- PATTERNS: Players will engage in the fight if they understand the patterns of the enemies, so when developing think and playtest the patterns to seeif they are easy to understand and engalling, rather than too challenging or even boring.
- PLAYTESTING: Test the enemies, all the attacks, reactions and movements. 
- REGULATED ATTACKS: Enemies must not attack all together, and that should be regulated. For example, if the player is encountering a group of enemies, if they attack at the same time the player would recieve loads of damage that could hurt them of kill them and that would frustrate the player. In order to avoid this, attacks must be regulated so the player can have time to move or act between one attack and another.
