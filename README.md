## Enemy Behaviour
The main objective for designers when creating enemies is engage the player to fight and feel like a real fight.

## What to take in mind

- OFFSCREEN: Enemies must attack on screen, almost never off screen. Take this in mind specially when developing 2D games to make enemies be aware of the camera limits or it will result in frustration for players as they will recieve damage without seeing who is attacking.
- REGULATED ATTACKS: Enemies must not attack all together. For example, if the player is encountering a group of enemies, if they attack at the same time the player would recieve loads of damage that could hurt them of kill them and that would frustrate the player. In order to avoid this, attacks must be regulated so the player can have time to move or act between one attack and another.
- PLAYTESTING: Test the enemies, all the attacks, reactions and movements.
